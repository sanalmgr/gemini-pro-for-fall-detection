# Evaluating Gemini 1.5: Tackling Complex Time-Series Fall Detection with Long Contexts

[Youtube Video Link]

## Introduction
This notebook investigates the use of **Gemini 1.5-pro**, a state-of-the-art generative AI model, for handling complex fall detection tasks in time-series data. Fall detection is a critical problem in healthcare and safety, involving intricate patterns in accelerometer data. By leveraging Gemini 1.5's long context handling capabilities, we explore both **zero-shot** and **few-shot prompting** to classify falls effectively.

## About This Notebook
This notebook was designed to systematically evaluate the performance of Gemini 1.5 on a real-world time-series dataset, **SmartFall 2018**. The dataset contains accelerometer readings across 50 timesteps for each sample, labeled as either a "fall" or "no fall." The notebook uses a subset of the data to fit within the model's token limit.

### Key Features of This Notebook
1. **Dataset Preparation**: 
   - Loads and preprocesses the **SmartFall 2018 dataset**, including creating sliding windows and balanced samples for training and testing.
   - Explains the labeling process for "fall" and "no fall" events.

2. **Zero-Shot Classification**:
   - Demonstrates how Gemini 1.5 performs without prior task-specific examples.
   - Provides insights into recall and false-positive rates.

3. **Few-Shot Classification**:
   - Utilizes a small set of labeled examples to improve prediction precision.
   - Compares results with zero-shot classification for a holistic understanding.

4. **Performance Metrics**:
   - Computes classification reports and confusion matrices to measure precision, recall, and accuracy.
   - Visualizes confusion matrices for intuitive comparison of results.

5. **Insights**:
   - Discusses the trade-offs between zero-shot and few-shot prompting for fall detection in time-series data.
   - Highlights the potential of Gemini 1.5 for complex tasks like fall detection.
